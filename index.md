Hey-o! I'm Kat, a computational oceanographer.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Climate, Ocean, and Sea-ice Modeling (COSIM) Team][] at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. I am currently developing new capabilities within the physical and biogeochemical ocean components of the Department of Energy's Earth system model, called [E3SM][], to improve its performance and accuracy. Addtionally, as a part of the [Interdisciplinary Research for Arctic Coastal Environments (InteRFACE)][] project I am running and analyzing Arctic focused Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to better understand the impacts of sea-ice loss on mixing and stratification in the Arctic Ocean and validate new higher-order mixing parameterizations, as well as, running and analyzing Arctic focused climate simulations, using E3SM, to better understand the impacts of climate change on the food security/sovereignty of Arctic communities.

To get a more detailed view of my journey, check out the following:
