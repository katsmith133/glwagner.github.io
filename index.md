Hey-o! I'm Kat, a computational oceanographer.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP)][] at the University of Cambridge. I perform direct numerical and large eddy simulations of turbulent ocean processes and small-scale biophyscial interactions. Broadly speaking, my research career path has been towards understanding small-scale turbulent processes within the ocean and how they influence the mixing, transport, and fate of climate relevant tracers, such as phytoplankton, nutrients, carbon dioxide, and particulate organic matter. The long-term goal is to use this understanding to improve existing and/or develop new subgrid scale parameterizations of biophysical interactions within Earth system models.
